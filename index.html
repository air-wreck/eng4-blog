      This blog is a yearlong project for Ms. Agazarian's senior English class at High Technology High School. When I'm not dying a death-by-college-apps, death-by-multivar, or death-by-physics, I'll post occasionally about a (computer-related) topic that has struck my fancy.

      On the technical side of this, the site is being statically generated with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages. You can find out more by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/air-wreck/eng4-blog">source repository</a>.
