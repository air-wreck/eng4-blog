Over this beautiful long weekend (possibly the best part about living in New Jersey is the reliable mini-break due to our annual teacher's convention), I really wasn't in the mood to do much serious coding work (but do check out this cool new [website](https://rogueroboticsclub.github.io)). So, I decided to make myself feel better by re-watching one of my childhood favorites. No, I didn't re-watch *Finding [Nemo](https://www.marinetech.org/files/marine/files/ROV%20Competition/2018%20competition/Team%20Documentation/RANGER/RogueRobotics_RogueUnderwaterSolutions_TechnicalDocumentation_2018.pdf)*...I re-watched (part of) HBO's *From the Earth to the Moon*! (Okay, I promise I'll try to stop these shameless Rogue Robotics plugs.)

If you're uncultured and haven't heard of it before (or only know the Jules Verne novel of the same name), *From the Earth to the Moon* is a twelve-part docudrama chronicling the early days of the US manned space program. Besides reliving the haunting [intro sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhZhzt1rh7o) and learning some interesting things about free software and commercial DVDs (which I do plan to discuss in a future post), this got me thinking about the topic of this post: the state of computing technology in the 1960s, particularly the computers onboard the Apollo spacecraft that went to the moon.

It's often been said that the entire Apollo flight computers didn't have as much power as a modern pocket calculator. This is likely false, but it certainly makes for a good quote.
