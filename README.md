> a yearlong project for Ms. Agazarian's English 4 class

This is the source repository for senior year English blog project. There's not much going on here beyond your run-of-the-mill Jekyll site. The styling is all custom done, so I'm not sure how nice it'll look on various platforms. See the site running [here](https://air-wreck.github.io/eng4-blog).
