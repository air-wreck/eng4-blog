As required in the assignment, here is a list of some cool blogs that I think are worth checking out. In no particular order:

### 1. The Quest for Tetris
I'm not going to pretend that I understand half of the technical details, but this is quite the epic quest. A few years ago, someone posted a [challenge](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life) on the Code Golf Stack Exchange to build a program to play Tetris...in Conway's game of life. After years of hard work, a team of experts finally cracked it...by implementing an entire computer with cellular automata. [This blog](http://blog.phinotpi.com/) documents the technical marvel that is the final computer.

### 2. Project Zero
[Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/)'s blog is certainly not for the faint of heart. They go into a lot of detail on vulnerabilities discovered by Google's Project Zero team (basically a bunch of people who get paid to find vulnerabilities in just about anything). A lot of the exploits that they find are extremely cutting-edge (e.g. [Meltdown](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)).

### 3. Random ASCII
[This](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/) is an interesting blog by one Bruce Dawson, who describes himeslf as a programmer working at Google on Chrome for Windows. It's mostly a bunch of miscellaneous tech topics. What could be more interesting than watching a Google guy ride to work on an [off-road unicycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys_jLSh8anI&list=PLruaMhkVkeS-3FI2mtjTlMffGNrIz85pH&index=2)?
