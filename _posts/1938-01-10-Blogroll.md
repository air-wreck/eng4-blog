As required in the assignment, here is a list of some cool blogs that I think are worth checking out. In no particular order:

---
### 1. The Quest for Tetris
I'm not going to pretend that I understand half of the technical details, but this is quite the epic quest. A few years ago, someone posted a [challenge](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/11880/build-a-working-game-of-tetris-in-conways-game-of-life) on the Code Golf Stack Exchange to build a program to play Tetris...in Conway's game of life. After years of hard work, a team of experts finally cracked it...by implementing an entire computer with cellular automata. [This blog](http://blog.phinotpi.com/) documents the technical marvel that is the final computer.

### 2. Project Zero
[Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/)'s blog is certainly not for the faint of heart. They go into a lot of detail on vulnerabilities discovered by Google's Project Zero team (basically a bunch of people who get paid to find vulnerabilities in just about anything). A lot of the exploits that they find are extremely cutting-edge (e.g. [Meltdown](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)).

### 3. Random ASCII
[This](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/) is an interesting blog by one Bruce Dawson, who describes himself as a programmer working at Google on Chrome for Windows. It's mostly a bunch of miscellaneous tech topics. What could be more interesting than watching a Google guy ride to work on an [off-road unicycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys_jLSh8anI&list=PLruaMhkVkeS-3FI2mtjTlMffGNrIz85pH&index=2)?

### 4. Joel on Software
I highly recommend [this blog](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), which happens to be written by the co-founder of Stack Overflow. The posts date back to 1999 and mostly feature miscellaneous software development stuff. Unlike the blogs listed above, Joel has a very clear writing style; he manages to go in-depth with his topics while still being perfectly accessible, even if your programming experience is pretty much limited to CoPE.

### 5. Moxie Marlinspike
Okay, that's not his real name, but [his website](https://moxie.org/blog/) (which includes a blog) is pretty cool. He used to be head of security at Twitter and is extremely well-known in the computer security world. He's also an ardent anarchist who sails and train-hops (or at least did at one point). I actually haven't pursued his blog much, but the "stories" on his website are *really* cool.

Does [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/) count as a blog? They're (usually) pretty funny.
