# eng4-blog

> a yearlong project for Ms. Agazarian's English 4 class

This is the source repository for my senior year English blog project. There's not much going on here beyond your run-of-the-mill Jekyll site. The page styling is all custom done, but the post body styling is handled by [Github Markdown](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css). See the site running [here](https://blog.ericzheng.org).

## running locally
Github Pages automatically builds this site using Jekyll. If you want to build it locally, you'll need to install `ruby` and get the gems `bundler`, `jekyll`, and `github-pages`. Then, you can just run `jekyll build` to generate a local `_site/` directory with the statically built website or run `jekyll serve` to additionally serve it locally on your machine.

## blog scope
I haven't really finalized my ideas about the blog title or topic, but as per the assignment, all my posts need to be somehow related to one central thing. I'm going to provisionally say that that topic will be "computers."
